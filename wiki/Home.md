# NexusOS - WNSP P2P Hub Wiki

## Welcome to NexusOS

**NexusOS** is a revolutionary civilization operating system that replaces traditional binary computation with electromagnetic wave states and bases all economic transactions on quantum physics (E=hf). It guarantees Basic Human Living Standards (BHLS) at 1,150 NXT/month per citizen.

## What Makes NexusOS Revolutionary?

### 1. Physics-Based Validation
Traditional blockchains use SHA-256 hashes. NexusOS uses **electromagnetic wave physics**:
- Maxwell equation solvers
- Wave superposition validation
- 5D wave signature verification
- Multi-band spectral consensus (PoSPECTRUM)

### 2. Quantum Economics (E=hf)
Every transaction costs energy based on Planck's equation:
```
E = h × f × n_cycles × authority²

Where:
  E = Energy cost in NXT base units
  h = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
  f = Frequency = c / λ (speed of light / wavelength)
  n_cycles = Number of wave cycles (message size factor)
  authority = Band authority level (1-7)
```

### 3. True Peer-to-Peer Mesh
- No central servers required
- Phone-to-phone direct communication
- Works offline (mesh routing)
- Censorship-resistant by design

### 4. BHLS Guarantee
Every citizen is guaranteed a floor of **1,150 NXT/month** for basic living standards.

## Core Philosophy

> **"Your phone IS the blockchain node."**

NexusOS is designed around the principle that every smartphone should be a fully functional node in a decentralized network. No mining rigs. No data centers. Just people connecting directly with each other.

> **"Constructing the rules of nature into the governance of civilization."**

All economic transactions follow E=hf. Physics, not politics, determines value.
