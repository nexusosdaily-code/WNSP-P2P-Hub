# NexusOS Advance Systems

### Overview
NexusOS Advance Systems is a comprehensive economic system simulator based on the Nexus equation, offering a self-regulating system with issuance/burn mechanics, PID feedback control, and conservation constraints. It models a multi-factor ecosystem, providing configurable parameters, real-time visualization, scenario management with PostgreSQL persistence, and data export. Key capabilities include Monte Carlo and Sensitivity Analysis, Multi-Agent Network Simulation, Smart Contract Code Generation (Solidity, Rust/ink!), Oracle Integration, ML-Based Adaptive Parameter Tuning, and User Authentication with Role-Based Access Control. The platform aims to provide robust tools for economic modeling and analysis.

### User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

### System Architecture

#### UI/UX Decisions
The application utilizes Streamlit for a single-page, wide-layout dashboard with an expanded sidebar for parameter configuration. Session state is used to manage simulation results, signal configurations, and parameter sets. Plotly provides interactive visualizations, including subplot-based time-series plots.

#### Technical Implementations
**Core Engine**: The `NexusEngine` implements the mathematical simulation, incorporating differential equations, feedback loops, multi-factor system health calculation, a PID controller, and dynamic issuance mechanisms. A Numba-optimized version (`NexusEngineNumba`) significantly improves performance for large-scale simulations.

**Data Storage**: SQLAlchemy ORM manages `SimulationConfig` for parameter sets and `SimulationRun` for simulation results, including time-series data stored as JSON.

**Signal Generation**: A Strategy pattern with a `SignalGenerator` class provides various signal types (constant, sinusoidal, step, random walk, pulse, linear ramp) for external inputs.

**Advanced Scenario Analysis**: Includes Monte Carlo Simulation for statistical distributions, Sensitivity Analysis for parameter importance, and Stability Region Mapping using 2D parameter space heatmaps.

**Multi-Agent Network Simulation**: Supports multi-node simulations with individual NexusEngines, various network topologies, inter-node value transfer via DAG-based optimization, and network influence mechanisms. It features sequential, DAG-optimized, and vectorized transaction processing modes.

**Smart Contract Code Generation**: Automatically generates deployable smart contracts for Ethereum/EVM (Solidity) and Substrate/Polkadot (Rust/ink!) based on simulation parameters.

**Oracle Integration Framework**: Provides an abstraction layer for integrating external data sources, featuring comprehensive error handling with retry logic, exponential backoff, and a circuit breaker pattern.

**ML-Based Adaptive Parameter Tuning**: Uses Bayesian Optimization (scikit-optimize) to optimize parameter configurations for multiple objective functions (stability, conservation, growth).

**User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control**: Implements user accounts, roles (admin, researcher, viewer), and session-based authentication using bcrypt for password hashing and SHA-256 for session tokens.

**Real-time Production Dashboard**: A comprehensive monitoring dashboard with auto-refresh, live KPI tiles, system health monitoring, and an intelligent alerting system with configurable rules and event management.

**WNSP (Wavelength-Native Signaling Protocol) Integration**: Integrates an optical communication protocol for mesh networking, mapping letters to wavelengths. It includes modules for wavelength mapping, frame encoding/decoding, and a Streamlit visualization interface for encoding, decoding, and spectrum analysis.

**Wavelength Cryptography Domain**: A DAG-based encryption/decryption system using electromagnetic theory principles. Implements four encryption methods: Frequency Shift (FSE) simulating electron energy transitions, Amplitude Modulation (AME) varying photon intensity, Phase Modulation (PME) using wave interference, and Quantum-Inspired Multi-Layer (QIML) combining all three. Based on E=hc/λ (Planck-Einstein relation) and discrete electron energy levels. Fully integrated into Task Orchestration with workflow automation for encrypt, decrypt, and theory demonstration operations.

**Secure Messaging Integration**: Wavelength cryptography is integrated into the core communication system as advanced messaging handlers. The `CommunicationTaskHandlers` class now includes `send_wavelength_encrypted_message` and `decrypt_wavelength_message` operations, allowing secure message transmission via email, SMS, or in-app notifications. Secure messaging workflows are available in the Task Orchestration Core domain, enabling one-click encrypted communication with electromagnetic theory-based security. User-friendly compose interface with encryption key management, automated encrypt/decrypt workflows, and inbox for sent messages.

**User Guidance System**: Comprehensive informational tabs integrated throughout the application via `app_info_content.py`. Each major module includes "How to Use" guides with step-by-step instructions and "Documentation" sections explaining purpose and problem-solving. Help icons (ℹ️) provide quick access to guidance without cluttering the interface. "About NexusOS" page available for public display, presenting the platform's unified intelligence ecosystem. Guides cover Dashboard, Task Orchestration, Secure Messaging, Economic Simulator, and more.
