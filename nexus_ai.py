            - Calculate optimal USD→NXT conversion rates for floor credit distribution

            - Measure floor sustainability under varying recycling participation rates (50%, 70%, 90%)
            - Test shock scenarios: population surges, message burn reductions, recycling collapse
            - Optimize floor credit distribution: daily vs. weekly vs. monthly batches
            - Calculate minimum debt backing required for perpetual floor funding
            
            **Multi-Variable Sensitivity Analysis**:
            - Run parameter sweeps: α, β, γ, δ (Nexus equation coefficients)
            - Test PID controller tuning (Kp, Ki, Kd) for different stability targets
            - Compare entropy reduction strategies: recycling vs. circular economy vs. supply chain efficiency
            - Model validator incentive impacts on contribution index (C parameter)
            
            **Long-Term Projections**:
            - 50-year simulations: Can debt backing sustain BHLS indefinitely?
            - Generational stability: Does civilization health improve over time?
            - Economic equilibrium: At what debt/NXT ratio does system stabilize?
            - Catastrophic scenario testing: What if global debt stops growing?
